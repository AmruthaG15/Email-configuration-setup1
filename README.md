# README for Email Configuration Setup in Cisco Packet Tracer

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the configuration of email services in a simulated network environment using Cisco Packet Tracer. The setup includes a mail server and client devices, utilizing SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for sending emails and POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3) for receiving them. The goal is to provide hands-on experience with email protocols, server setup, and troubleshooting.

## Key Features
- **SMTP Configuration**: Enables sending emails from client devices to the mail server.
- **POP3 Configuration**: Allows clients to retrieve emails from the mail server.
- **Network Simulation**: Uses Cisco Packet Tracer to create a virtual network with email capabilities.
- **User Accounts**: Creation and management of email accounts for testing communication.

## Project Structure
- **Introduction**: Overview of email protocols and the simulation tool.
- **Background**: Importance of email communication and role of protocols.
- **Implementation**: Step-by-step guide to setting up the network and configuring email services.
- **Screenshots**: Visual documentation of the email configuration and testing process.
- **Conclusion**: Summary of learnings and challenges faced during the project.

## Screenshots
- **Fig1**: Email configuration setup.
- **Fig2**: Email received on PC0.
- **Fig3**: Email received on PC1.

## How It Works
1. **Composing and Sending**: A user composes an email on their client, which is sent via SMTP to the mail server.
2. **Processing**: The mail server receives and stores the email in the recipient's mailbox.
3. **Retrieving**: The recipient's client retrieves the email using POP3.
4. **Reading**: The recipient can now read the email on their device.

## Challenges
- Understanding the roles of SMTP and POP3.
- Correctly configuring the mail server and client settings.
- Implementing secure authentication methods.
- Troubleshooting email delivery issues.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the configuration of email services in a simulated network, highlighting the importance of proper setup for reliable and secure communication. It serves as a practical learning tool for networking students and professionals.
